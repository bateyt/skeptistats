Welcome to __SkeptiStats__. I'm a biological anthropologist who also identifies as an atheist, skeptic, and secular humanist. I wanted to create a website to expose the incorrect---or, even worse, outright dishonest---use of statistics. I thought this might be a good place for that, and I even get to practice my skills in [R](http://www.r-project.org/).
